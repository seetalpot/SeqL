# SeqL
The repository contains SeqL and EFF scan-locked, scan-unrolled benchmarks and attack evaluation setups for:

1. Boolean Satisfiability based attack (sat: https://bitbucket.org/spramod/host15-logic-encryption)
2. Satisfiability Modulo Theory based attack (smt: https://github.com/gate-lab/SMTAttack)
3. Functional Analysis on Logic Locking attack (fall: https://bitbucket.org/spramod/fall-attacks/src/master/)
4. Oracleless attack (hacktest)
5. Multi-cycle attack (eff-multi-cycle-tests, seql-multi-cycle-tests)
6. Running attacks on RISC-V processor (riscv).

SeqL is currently semi-automated, end-to-end automation is in progress.
