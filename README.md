# SeqL
The repository contains SeqL and EFF scan-locked, scan-unrolled benchmarks and attack setups for:

Boolean Satisfiability based attack (sat)
Satisfiability Modulo Theory based attack (smt)
Functional Analysis on Logic Locking attack (fall)
Oracleless attack (hacktest)
Multi-cycle attack (eff-multi-cycle-tests, seql-multi-cycle-tests)
Running attacks on RISC-V processor (riscv).
SeqL is currently semi-automated, end-to-end automation is in progress.
